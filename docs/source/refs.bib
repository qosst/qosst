@article{DistillationOfDeveta2005,
  abstract = {<jats:p>We study and solve the problem of distilling a secret key from quantum states representing correlation between two parties (Alice and Bob) and an eavesdropper (Eve) via one\textendash{}way public discussion: we prove a coding theorem to achieve the `wire\textendash{}tapper' bound, the difference of the mutual information Alice\textendash{}Bob and that of Alice\textendash{}Eve, for so\textendash{}called classical\textendash{}quantum\textendash{}quantum\textendash{}correlations, via one\textendash{}way public communication. This result yields information\textendash{}theoretic formulae for the distillable secret key, giving `ultimate' key rate bounds if Eve is assumed to possess a purification of Alice and Bob's joint state. Specializing our protocol somewhat and making it coherent leads us to a protocol of entanglement distillation via one\textendash{}way LOCC (local operations and classical communication) which is asymptotically optimal: in fact we prove the so\textendash{}called `hashing inequality', which says that the coherent information (i.e. the negative conditional von Neumann entropy) is an achievable Einstein\textendash{}Podolsky\textendash{}Rosen rate. This result is known to imply a whole set of distillation and capacity formulae, which we briefly review.</jats:p>},
