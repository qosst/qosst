# Contributing

## Report issues

Reporting issues is the first way to contribute to the software.

You can report global issue with the software on the issues tracker of QOSST at [https://github.com/qosst/qosst/issues](https://github.com/qosst/qosst/issues).

It is however preferable to use the specialized repo for issues that are specific to a module:

| Module        | URL of the issues tracker                                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `qosst-core`  | [https://github.com/qosst/qosst-core/issues](https://github.com/qosst/qosst-core/issues)   |
| `qosst-hal`   | [https://github.com/qosst/qosst-hal/issues](https://github.com/qosst/qosst-hal/issues)     |
| `qosst-alice` | [https://github.com/qosst/qosst-alice/issues](https://github.com/qosst/qosst-alice/issues) |
| `qosst-bob`   | [https://github.com/qosst/qosst-bob/issues](https://github.com/qosst/qosst-bob/issues)     |
| `qosst-skr`   | [https://github.com/qosst/qosst-skr/issues](https://github.com/qosst/qosst-skr/issues)     |
| `qosst-sim`   | [https://github.com/qosst/qosst-sim/issues](https://github.com/qosst/qosst-sim/issues)     |
